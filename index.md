I am currently a research assistant (PostDoc) at [Center for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science (CAIDAS)](https://www.caidas.uni-wuerzburg.de/), [University of Würzburg](https://www.uni-wuerzburg.de/) in Germany. I'm co-supervised by [Prof. Dr. Christof Weiß](https://www.caidas.uni-wuerzburg.de/ch/team/christof-weiss/) and [Prof. Dr. Goran Glavaš](https://sites.google.com/view/goranglavas), from the [Computational Humanities (CH)](https://www.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de/ch/) group and [Natural Language Processing (WüNLP)](https://www.caidas.uni-wuerzburg.de/nlp/) group. 

Before joining CAIDAS, I did my PhD in [UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in AI and Music (AIM CDT)](https://www.aim.qmul.ac.uk/), at [Centre for Digital Music (C4DM)](http://c4dm.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/), [Queen Mary University of London (QMUL)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/) in the UK. My PhD is co-supervised by [Dr. Emmanouil Benetos](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~emmanouilb/), [Dr. Veronica Morfi](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=8izRvu4AAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Simon Dixon](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~simond/).

My main research interest is in the intersection of AI and music. For the past years, I have been working on automatic music transcription, more broadly, in music information retrieval (e.g., beat tracking, music performance analysis, multimodal music analysis). Beyond music, I'm also curious about AI and language, culture studies.
