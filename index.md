## Introduction

A large part of my research interest falls in the intersection of AI and music. Currently, my main research interest is in automatic music transcription. I am developing algorithms that can transcribe music audio recordings into a readable score format, e.g. MusicXML.

More generally, I'm also interested in:

- Music Information Retreival
- Symbolic Music Modelling
- Automatic Music Composition
- Natural Language Processing
